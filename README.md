# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python project aimed at performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The project focuses on analyzing tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Project Overview

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a crucial task in understanding public opinion on various topics. This project demonstrates how to preprocess tweet data, extract meaningful features, and apply machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization of tweet text.
  - Handling of hashtags, mentions, and special characters.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Visualizing word frequencies, hashtags, and sentiment distributions.
- **Sentiment Classification**:
  - Implementing models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Project Structure

- `updated_sentiment_analysis_with_pie.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory for the dataset used in the analysis (not included in this repository).
- `images/`: Directory for storing visualizations and plots generated during the analysis.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models (if applicable).

## Installation
